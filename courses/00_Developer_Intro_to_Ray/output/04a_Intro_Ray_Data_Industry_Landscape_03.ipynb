    "Orchestration platforms usually differ in the following ways:\n",
    "- **Language**: Some are natively written in Python, others are not.\n",
    "- **Ease of use**: Some have a rigid DAG/DSL interface, others have a more flexible API-based interface to creating tasks.\n",
    "- **Tilt towards ML vs Data Engineering**: Some are more focused on ML, some are more focused on Data Engineering.\n",
    "  - Some have native dataset concepts meant for data engineering whereas others have native workflow concepts meant for ML.\n",
    "- **Cost**: Some are cheaper than others depending on the commercial offering."
